### CTF №1
```
Gifter:
    This contract was created by an altruist who could no longer look at this world calmly,
    so he decided to create an action for people in need of help.
    For those who deposit a certain amount on the contract,
    he chooses a couple of addresses to whom he will double his deposit.
    But we all know what the harsh world does to all of us,
    so some who were lucky enough to double their deposit decided to rob an altruist for the same amount.
    Can you do the same?

### CTF №2
```
CheaperWETH:
    Some people are very keen on saving on transactions wherever possible, 
    like this enthusiast who decided to create a new WETH contract where all 
    functionality is implemented with Yul inserts. It's more economical, 
    no doubt, but has this contract undergone an audit?
    Your task is to withdraw all funds from the contract, starting with 15 ether.
